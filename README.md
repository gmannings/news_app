# News UI in Next.js

A small demo project to demonstrate how I typically write React/Next.js code. Notable areas of interest are:

* Image proxying to allow `<Image />` to work with article thumbnails and not needing a domain whitelist
* Server-side API services so the API key is hidden from client-side code
